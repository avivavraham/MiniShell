# MiniShell
This GitHub repository contains a simple shell program implementation aimed at gaining hands-on experience with process management, pipes, signals, and relevant system calls.
The program allows users to execute commands, run commands in the background, use single piping, and redirect output to files.
In this assignment I implemented a linux shell behaviour and gained experience with process management,
 * pipes, signals, and the relevant system calls.
 * credit- for all the code I have writen in this assignment I have to give credit for Code Vault YouTube videos.

 * in this Unix Processes in C playlist, I have learned all the methods and structures I have needed for this assignment.
 * except for dealing with zombies processes which I gave credit locally.
